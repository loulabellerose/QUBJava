Exercises from my Programming in Java module at Queens

Java class files have been pulled out of packages for easier visibility of code - files are not intended to run

The double module was assessed with a series of closed-book practical exams rather than coursework so this repo is aimed to simply reflect on what I learned in my time at Queens
